“I see many people hating the government. When you look at it from a consciousness level what role are they playing in our belief systems???? The “external” reality is just a projection of our inner self. They are representing protection from our own fears. When we feel we do not need to be protected from our fears or shadow self anymore then we will not need a external projection of the idea of a government who “protects us”. When we take responsibility for our reality 100 percent we will become our own governing mechanism. Not through force but through acceptance of self.”
