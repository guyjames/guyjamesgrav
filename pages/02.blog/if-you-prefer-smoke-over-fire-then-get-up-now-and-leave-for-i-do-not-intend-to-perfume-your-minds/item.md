“

If you prefer smoke over fire  
 then get up now and leave.  
 For I do not intend to perfume  
 your mind’s clothing  
 with more sooty knowledge.

No, I have something else in mind.  
 Today I hold a flame in my left hand  
 and a sword in my right.  
 There will be no damage control today.

For God is in a mood  
 to plunder your riches and  
 fling you nakedly  
 into such breathtaking poverty  
 that all that will be left of you  
 will be a tendency to shine.

So don’t just sit around this flame  
 choking on your mind.  
 For this is no campfire song  
 to mindlessly mantra yourself to sleep with.

Jump now into the space  
 between thoughts  
 and exit this dream  
 before I burn the damn place down.

”
