The endless sweep of the horizon  
 From my window seat, the sea  
 Gazing past the concrete holiday boxes  
 Today the wind is fierce  
 A hulk with two cranes shelters distantly in the bay  
 Overpowering banks of light trained on the shore  
 Pin points as  
 The sun sinks into the grey beyond

The steel sides groan against the waves  
 Its lights now become the sun  
 We can only know the endless by that which seems to end  
 The great ship made tiny by the sea  
 But where do I end and the waves begin?

In my dream I saw the same ship before now  
 Lashed by terrible storms  
 The empty vessel facing a grey sky alone  
 Like the boat in my mother’s painting  
 Unconsciously waiting for the end  
 Untethered and drifting towards emptiness

Are we lovers of truth?  
 What you love becomes the cornerstone of your life  
 Your limitations show the glory of the endless  
 The body’s empty vessel must be lost to the waves one day  
 But what remains  
 Holds the sea and sky in its gaze  
 Let the endless breakers roll to the horizon

Where do I begin?
