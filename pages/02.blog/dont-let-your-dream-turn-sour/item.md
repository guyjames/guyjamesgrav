> “Many quit just before they hit the jackpot. Then they complain that the Universal Law does not provide for them, which is a bunch of rubbish. If you don’t have what you want, it means that you are still on the journey. You might be close to the goal, yet being close to the best restaurant is not dinner. You have to press on to that final glorious conclusion.”

Stuart Wilde, in “*Affirmations*”
