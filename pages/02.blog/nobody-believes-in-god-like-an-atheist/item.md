> But the atheist, you see — the man who advertises his disbelief in god — is a very pious person. Nobody believes in god like an atheist. ‘There is no god, and I am his prophet.’

*Alan Watts*

I’ve always thought that Richard Dawkins and his followers have an evangelical air about them, confirmed by the ‘Atheist Ad Campaign’:

I mean if religion is a bad thing, then why drag yourself down to their level? Who cares what other people believe, surely it’s a personal thing? What happened to ‘live and let live’?

I’ll support their right to say it till the last breath in my body, but it doesn’t mean that this kind of piety in the name of no-god is ultimately a healthy thing.

If you subscribe to the [Alan Watts Podcast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/alanwatts) and download ‘Religion of No Religion #1′ then you can hear more of Mr. Watts’ views on atheism.
