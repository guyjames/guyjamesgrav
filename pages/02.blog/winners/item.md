“O gifted men, vainglorious for first place,  
 how short a time the laurel crown stays green  
 ……………………………………..  
 A breath of wind is all there is to fame  
 here upon earth: it blows this way and that,  
 and when it changes quarter it changes name.”

– Dante.

It’s a shame that the winner in Formula 1 no longer gets a laurel wreath like they used to. Perhaps because we have forgotten that success is inherently transient.
