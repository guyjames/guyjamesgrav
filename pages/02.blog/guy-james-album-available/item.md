My self-titled album has now been re-released. It was available for a short time at amiestreet.com but that was bought by Amazon and everything on that site was never seen again.

So you can listen to it and if you like, buy it (please do!) at [music.guyjames.com](http://music.guyjames.com).

It was a real labour of love and I have to say I am very pleased with it. Big thanks to Scutty Lefunk who helped out with large parts of it and contributed two of the greatest guitar solos you will hear, on ‘Crashing on the rocks in your head’ and ‘Residue’.

I re-released it at 11.11.11 on the 11.11.2011.
