Unfortunately it appears Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four and Huxley’s Brave New World were BOTH right!

BNW is the carrot (consumerism and various drugs) and 1984 is the stick (total surveillance, information management and a hollow ‘democracy’).

We can only hope that the darkest hour is just before the dawn…
