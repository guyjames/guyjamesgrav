“You stop the internal dialogue the same way you would do with external dialogue. External and internal is just a made-up. The major segmentation we make in our lives is external and internal. It’s a false distinction. What’s internal is external, what’s external is internal. So, when a conversation starts in your mind, you just stop. And when the thought says: “I can’t stop!”, you just bow and say: “No, sorry, it’s a silent retreat.”. I never dreamed that there was a possibility of stopping the internal dialogue, until my teacher told me I could stop. I thought something would have to descend on me, or there would have to be a level of purification, or some alignement of the planets, or in some future life-time, but he said: “Forget all that, it’s part of the conversation! Just stop right now, and be still, effortlessly”.”
