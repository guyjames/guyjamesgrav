“There is no urgency. Summer does not rush towards autumn. One tiny blade of grass is not trying to grow faster than its neighbour. The planets spin lazily in their orbits. This ancient universe is in no hurry.  
 But the mind, feeling so divided from the totality, wants answers now, wants solutions today, wants to know so badly. It wants to reach its precious conclusions. And, ultimately, it wants to be in control.  
 But you are not the mind. Mind is an aspect of the whole, but cannot capture the whole.  
 So slow down, friend. Take a deep and conscious breath. Trust the place where you are, the place of ‘no answers yet’, the precious place of not knowing. This place is sacred, for it is 100% life. It is full of life, saturated with life, dripping with life, drenched with life.  
 Don’t try to rush to the next scene in the movie of ‘me’. Be here, in this scene, Now, the only scene there is.  
 Now is the place where questions rest, and creative solutions grow.”

SLOW DOWN, FRIEND
