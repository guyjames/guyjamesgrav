“Learn to get in touch with the innermost essence of your being. This true essence is beyond the ego. It is fearless; it is free; it is immune to criticism; it does not fear any challenge. It is beneath no one, superior to no one, and full of magic, mystery, and enchantment.”

 – *Deepak Chopra (via [nirvikalpa](http://nirvikalpa.tumblr.com/))*
