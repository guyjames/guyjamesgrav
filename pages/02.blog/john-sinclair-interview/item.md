“SINCLAIR: Thats exactly what it is: unity of government, industry and the banks. And no one is doing better right now than the banks. Because they had that deficit down, you see? The banks cant make any money without a deficit. So now they’ve got the biggest deficit of all time! So that means theyre just shoveling millions and billions of dollars into the banks in interest. I havent read my paper yet today, but maybe they’ve taken the prime rate down to 1/2 or 3/4 of a percent. Can you imagine how much money theyre making on that? To buy money for half a percent and sell it to you for, you know, whatever. If its a credit card company they’re selling it to you for 29%! I mean, those are UNBELIEVABLE profits. ”
