“What they need to do is take the internet, and instead of portraying it as some sort of platform in which they just show people’s dogs falling down stairs, they should use this and find a way of imaginatively constructing new things out of it. It’ll be complicated, because the internet is quite anti-narrative, it goes all over the shop, but I know full well someone somewhere will take that and turn it into something like a Dickens novel, and use it to take people out of themselves. And I tell you, there’s no one at the BBC thinking like that. And it’s about time they did. ” – [http://tinyurl.com/3xmlxgj](http://tinyurl.com/3xmlxgj "Adam Curtis")
