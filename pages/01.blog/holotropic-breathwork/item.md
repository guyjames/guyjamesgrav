“The psyche has an almost relentless tendency to create and draw toward itself experiences that match the experiential quality of the unconscious inner material. Thus, a person with leftover trauma from choking in the birth canal will unconsciously create situations of high stress, with no room to breathe or the world closing in. These patterns can persist indefinitely until the material is faced on the level from which it originates as powerful leftover emotions from within the psyche.”
