The only time I’ve \*really\* felt proud to be British in recent times was watching the recent Bill Hicks documentary. In the USA Bill was playing tiny clubs and people just didn’t ‘get’ him. He came to the UK and was soon selling out the 4,000 seater Dominion Theatre in London. His relief at finally being understood makes me proud of our ‘black’ sense of humour.
