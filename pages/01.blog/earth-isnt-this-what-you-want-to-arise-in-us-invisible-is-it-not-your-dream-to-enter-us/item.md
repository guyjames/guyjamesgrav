“

Earth, isn’t this what you want? To arise in us, invisible?

Is it not your dream, to enter us so wholly  
 there’s nothing left outside us to see?

What, if not transformation,  
 is your deepest purpose? Earth, my love,  
 I want it too. Believe me,  
 no more of your springtimes are needed  
 to win me over—even one flower  
 is more than enough. Before I was named  
 I belonged to you. I see no other law  
 but yours, and know I can trust  
 the death you will bring.

See, I live. On what?  
 Childhood and future are equally present.  
 Sheer abundance of being  
 floods my heart.
