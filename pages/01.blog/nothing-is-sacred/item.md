nothing is sacred  
 look above the clouds  
 the wind blows in the space between you and the distant stars  
 nothing is sacred… no one knows where it will go  
 the wind is silent until it touches you  
 you are part of the wind  
 the stars are in your brain  
 a black hole in your brain  
 nothing is sacred… no one knows how long  
 the sun is cold until it touches you  
 you are incandescent  
 you are the space between the notes  
 the distance is in your brain  
 you are part of the sun  
 nothing is sacred
